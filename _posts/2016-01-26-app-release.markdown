Yesterday at the Knight Foundation's [Demo Day](http://soapbox.systems/blog/2016/01/22/prototype-fund.html) the team behind Ombuds was proud to release the Ombuds app on the [Google Play Store](http://soapbox.systems://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=systems.soapbox.ombuds.client).
<!--more-->

The app is very minimal, but it supports all of the functionality marked with an X in the [specification](/spec/mobile-arch).

In broad strokes the app can:

- Send bulletins and endorsements
- Send and Receive bitcoin
- Browse Web Relays through Tor

Stay tuned, there is more to come.
