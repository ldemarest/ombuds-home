    <h2>Peer to peer</h2>
    <p>Ombuds’ nodes use the <strong>well researched and extensively tested</strong> Bitcoin peer-to-peer protocol. This network is <strong>trusted by organizations and individuals</strong> to promptly and securely transfer millions of dollars worth of bitcoin on a daily basis. As <strong>epiphytes</strong> in the larger Bitcoin ecosystem, Ombuds nodes have a small footprint that don’t interfere with Bitcoin as whole. </p>

    <h2>Immutable</h2>
    <p>Ombuds’ broadcasted posts <strong>become immutable</strong> once they are stored in the Bitcoin block chain. The Bitcoin block chain is <strong>distributed globally and inherently public</strong> due to economic incentives. Every post will be accessible and <strong>cannot be removed by you, by us, or by any authoritarian government</strong>.</p>
