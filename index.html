    <h2>Peer-to-Peer</h2>
    <p><strong>Ombuds</strong> uses the <strong>Bitcoin</strong> peer-to-peer protocol. As an <strong>epiphyte</strong>, Ombuds has a small footprint that interacts with thousands of Bitcoin nodes, but doesn't interfere with the larger Bitcoin ecosystem. Ombuds is well researched, extensively tested, and trusted by organizations and individuals.</p>
    <h2>Immutable</h2>
    <p><strong>Ombuds</strong>â€™ broadcasted posts become immutable once they are stored in the Bitcoin block chain.  All post will be accessible and <strong>cannot be destroyed</strong> by you, by us, or by any authoritarian government. The Bitcoin block chain is <strong>globally distributed</strong> and <strong>inherently public</strong> due to economic incentives.</p>
