    <h2>Peer-to-Peer</h2>
    <p><strong>Ombuds</strong> uses the <strong>Bitcoin</strong> peer-to-peer protocol. As an <strong>epiphyte</strong>, Ombuds has a small footprint that interacts with thousands of Bitcoin nodes, but doesn't interfere with the larger Bitcoin ecosystem. Ombuds is well researched, extensively tested, and trusted by organizations and individuals.</p>
    <h2>Immutable</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Ombuds</strong> enables any holder of Bitcoin to publish <strong>immutable statements</strong> within Bitcoin's block chain. These statements, which we call bulletins, are encoded within Bitcoin transactions which can be sent from a smartphone or a computer. If a Bitcoin user can get a transaction into the block chain it is <strong>effectively permanent</strong>.<sup>1</sup>
    </p>
    <p><sup>1</sup>
      To censor a user's bulletins, an attacker must either block access to Bitcoin completely or generate blocks faster than the entire honest network. Since most small nations do not have the hashing infrastructure to mount a 51% attack against the Bitcoin network, Ombuds's method for storing bulletins is <strong>robust</strong>.<sup>2</sup>
    </p>
    <p><sup>2</sup>
      This system does not depend on the honesty or availability of any single website, service or hard drive. Instead, Ombuds relies on the <strong>global and public distribution</strong> of the block chain to ensure the availability of its public record.
