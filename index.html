  <h2>Peer-to-Peer</h2>
  <p><strong>Ombuds</strong> uses the <strong>Bitcoin</strong> peer-to-peer protocol. As a Bitcoin <strong class="fn-s-1">epiphyte</strong><sup class="fn-s-1">1</sup>, Ombuds lives in and throughout the Bitcoin network, but doesn't interfere with the larger Bitcoin ecosystem. Ombuds is well researched and well tested.</p>
  <p class="footnote fn-1">
    <sup class="footnote-sup">1</sup>
    Ep-i-phyte <i>noun</i></br>
    a plant that grows on another plant but is not parasitic, such as ferns growing on trees in tropical rain forests.

  <h2>Immutable</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Ombuds</strong> enables any holder of Bitcoin to publish <strong>immutable statements</strong> within Bitcoin's block chain. These statements, which are called bulletins, are encoded within Bitcoin transactions which can be sent from a smartphone or a computer. If a user can get a transaction into the block chain it is <strong class="fn-s-2">effectively permanent</strong>.<sup class="fn-s-2">2</sup>
  </p>
  <p class="footnote fn-2">
    <sup class="footnote-sup">2</sup>
    To censor a user's bulletins, an attacker must either block access to Bitcoin completely or generate blocks faster than the entire honest network. Since most small nations do not have the hashing infrastructure to mount a 51% attack against the Bitcoin network, <strong>Ombuds's method for storing bulletins is robust</strong>.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote fn-2">
    This system does not depend on the honesty or availability of any single website, service or hard drive. Instead, Ombuds relies on the <strong>global and public distribution</strong> of the block chain to ensure the availability of this public record.

  Bitcoin is an experiment and Ombuds is an <strong class="fn-s-3">experimental public service</strong> built on top of it. It is no longer sufficient to rely on Twitter, Facebook, or your blog to protect your right to free expression online. Lets work towards making public expression <strong>public by design</strong>.
