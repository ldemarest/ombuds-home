  <h2>Peer-to-Peer</h2>
  <p><strong>Ombuds</strong> uses the <strong>Bitcoin</strong> peer-to-peer protocol. As a Bitcoin <strong class="fn-s-1">epiphyte</strong><sup class="fn-s-1">1</sup>, Ombuds lives in and throughout the Bitcoin network, but doesn't interfere with the larger Bitcoin ecosystem. Ombuds is well researched, extensively tested, and trusted by organizations and individuals.</p>
  <p class="footnote fn-1">
    <sup class="footnote-sup">1</sup>
    Ep-i-phyte <i>noun</i></br>
    a plant that grows on another plant but is not parasitic, such as ferns growing on trees in tropical rain forests.

  <h2>Immutable</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Ombuds</strong> enables any holder of Bitcoin to publish <strong>immutable statements</strong> within Bitcoin's block chain. These statements, which we call bulletins, are encoded within Bitcoin transactions which can be sent from a smartphone or a computer. If a user can get a transaction into the block chain it is <strong class="fn-s-2">effectively permanent</strong>.<sup class="fn-s-2">2</sup>
  </p>
  <p class="footnote fn-2">
    <sup class="footnote-sup">2</sup>
    To censor a user's bulletins, an attacker must either block access to Bitcoin completely or generate blocks faster than the entire honest network. Since most small nations do not have the hashing infrastructure to mount a 51% attack against the Bitcoin network, <strong>Ombuds's method for storing bulletins is robust</strong>.
  </p>
  <p class="footnote fn-2">
    This system does not depend on the honesty or availability of any single website, service or hard drive. Instead, Ombuds relies on the <strong>global and public distribution</strong> of the block chain to ensure the availability of its public record.

    Everyone can read an ombuds bulletin. Not everyone can read tweets, access facebook, or link others to their own personal, traditional blog. <strong class="fn-s-3">Ombuds can fill the widening space between an individual and society</strong>.<sup class="fn-s-3">3</sup>

    Bitcoin is an experiment and Ombuds is an experimental public service built on top of it.
